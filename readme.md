This project is to set up what will eventually be my CAD project.

TODO:
    Strangle quaternions into working for the field hitboxes (specifically the match load hitboxes)
    Improve performance with many triballs (somehow lmfao)
    Add an Inch constant
    Rework movement to be that of a CAD software (Inventor/Fusion360, not Blender)
